// // * Finally, although itâ€™s not a requirement, consider adding validation to ensure that user input is in the proper format.   
// * Write code in `index.js` that uses inquirer to gather information about the development team members and creates objects for each team member using the correct classes as blueprints.
// * When a user starts the application then they are prompted to enter the **team manager**â€™s:
//   * Name
//   * Employee ID
//   * Email address
//   * Office number
// * When a user enters those requirements then the user is presented with a menu with the option to:
//   * Add an engineer
//   * Add an intern 
//   * Finish building the team
// * When a user selects the **engineer** option then a user is prompted to enter the following and then the user is taken back to the menu:
//   * Engineer's Name
//   * ID
//   * Email
//   * GitHub username
// * When a user selects the intern option then a user is prompted to enter the following and then the user is taken back to the menu:
//   * Internâ€™s name
//   * ID
//   * Email
//   * School
